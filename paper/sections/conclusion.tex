This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive video analytics configuration framework, AutoConfigure. Our solution can adapt the best configuration to intrusive dynamics of video contexts, meaning that it can adaptively choose the proper configuration for the current video chunk according to the spatial and temporal features of video contexts. Therefore, our solution can adaptively update configuration strategy over time, and it adaptive to different location-camera inferences and different accuracy-demand services. In the evaluation, AutoConfigure achieves 10-35\% higher accuracy with a similar amount of resources or achieves similar accuracy with only 60-90\% of the resources. AutoConfigure proves to be more efficient than static solutions and only creates an overhead of 0.2-2\% to the overall video analytics services.
