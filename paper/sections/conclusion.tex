%This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive video analytics configuration framework, AdaConfigure. Our solution can adapt the best configuration to intrusive dynamics of video contexts, meaning that it can adaptively choose the proper configuration for the current video chunk according to the spatial and temporal features of video contexts. Therefore, our solution can adaptively update configuration strategy over time, and it adaptive to different location-camera inferences and various accuracy-demand services. In the evaluation, AdaConfigure achieves 10-35\% higher accuracy with a similar amount of resources or achieves similar accuracy with only 60-90\% of the resources. AdaConfigure proves to be more efficient than static solutions and only creates an overhead of 0.2-2\% to the overall video analytics services.

%First, we design a reinforcement learning-based framework in which an agent adaptively chooses the configuration according to the spatial and temporal features of the current video stream. In particular, we use a video segmentation strategy to capture the characteristics of the video stream with much-reduced computation cost: profiling a segment uses only 0.2-2\% computation resource as compared to a full video. Second, we design a reward function that considers both the inference accuracy and computation resource consumption so that the configuration achieves good accuracy and resource consumption tradeoff. Our evaluation experiments on object detection task show that our approach outperforms baseline: it achieves 10-35\% higher accuracy with a similar amount of computation resources or achieves similar accuracy with only 60-90\% of the computation resource.

%AdaConfigure improves the analytic accuracy while providing low-resource consumption. Furthermore, the extra cost of profiling is low since the agent's choosing time is hugely lower.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive video analytics configuration framework that can adapt the best configuration to the characteristics of the video stream with much-reduced profiling cost. Comparing to the static configuration baseline, our solution tremendously improves the analytic accuracy while providing low-resource consumption.
