This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based automatic video analytics configuration framework, AutoConfigure. Our solution can adapt the best configuration to intrusive dynamics of video contexts, meaning that it can periodically choose the proper configuration for the current video chunk according to the spatial and temporal correlation of video contexts. In the evaluation, AutoConfigure achieves 10-35\% higher accuracy with a similar amount of resources or achieves similar accuracy with only 60-90\% of the resources. AutoConfigure proves to be more efficient than static solutions and only creates an overhead of 0.1-1\% to the overall video analytics services.
